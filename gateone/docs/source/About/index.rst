About Gate One
**************
Gate One is an open source, web-based terminal emulator with a powerful plugin system.  It comes bundled with a plugin that turns Gate One into an amazing SSH client but Gate One can actually be used to run *any* terminal application.  You can even embed Gate One into other applications to provide an interface into serial consoles, virtual servers, or anything you like.  It's a great supplement to any web-based administration interface.

Gate One works in any browser that supports WebSockets.  No browser plugins required!
