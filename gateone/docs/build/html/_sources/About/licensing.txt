Licensing
=========
Gate One is released under a dual-license model.  You are free to choose the license that best meets your requirements:

    * The `GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3) <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html>`_.
    * Gate One Commercial licensing.

Open Source License Requirements
--------------------------------
The :abbr:`AGPLv3 (GNU Affero General Public License version 3)` is similar to the :abbr:`GPLv3 (GNU General Public License version 3)` in that it requires that you publicly release the source code of your application if you distribute binaries that use Gate One.  However, it has an additional obligation:  You must make your source code available to everyone if your application is provided as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or it's part of an Application Service Provider solution.

For example, if you're running Gate One on your server as part of a SaaS solution you must give away all of your source code.

Here are some examples where Open Source licensing makes sense:

 * Pre-installing Gate One as part of an open source Linux distribution.
 * Embedding Gate One into an open source application that is licensed under the AGPLv3 *or* the GPLv3 [#f1]_.
 * Bundling Gate One with an open source appliance.
 * Making Gate One available as part of an open source software repository.

**Considerations:** Unless you want your source code to be freely available to everyone you should opt for Gate One's Commercial License.

Gate One Commercial Licensing
-----------------------------
The Commercial License offerings for Gate One are very flexible and afford businesses the opportunity to include Gate One as part of their products and services without any source code obligations.  It also provides licensees with a fully-supported solution and assurances.

Here are some examples where commercial licensing is typically necessary:

 * Including Gate One in software sold to customers who install it on their own equipment.
 * Selling software that requires the installation of Gate One.
 * Selling hardware that comes with Gate One pre-installed.
 * Bundling with or including Gate One in any product protected by patents.

Even if you don't plan to embed Gate One into one of your own products, enterprise support options available.
