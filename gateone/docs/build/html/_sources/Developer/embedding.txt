Embedding Gate One Into Other Applications
==========================================

Gate One can be embedded into *any* web page (really!) *without* using an iframe.  Since that's not a common thing to do on the web (yet) you'll need to understand a few things like how it works, what you can do with it, and how to keep it secure.  This tutorial will teach you everything you need to know to get Gate One embedded into your web application.

To use the examples in this tutorial you must have Gate One installed on some host (*any* host) where you can run the 'gateone' command (you don't need root).  Alternatively, you can run Gate One out of a directory (e.g. the GateOne directory from 'git clone') using the 'run_gateone.py' command.
